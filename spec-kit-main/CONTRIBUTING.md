## Contributing to Spec Kit

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to Spec Kit. Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [project's open source license](LICENSE).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Prerequisites for running and testing code

These are one time installations required to be able to test your changes locally as part of the pull request (PR) submission process.

1. Install [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Have an AI coding agent available: [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the repository
1. Configure and install the dependencies: `uv sync`
1. Make sure the CLI works on your machine: `uv run specify --help`
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure everything still works
1. Test the CLI functionality with a sample project if relevant
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
1. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the project's coding conventions.
- Write tests for new functionality.
- Update documentation (`README.md,` `spec-driven.md`) if your changes affect user-facing features.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- Test your changes with the Spec-Driven Development workflow to ensure compatibility.

## Development workflow

When working on spec-kit:

1. Test changes with the `specify` CLI commands (`/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`) in your coding agent of choice
2. Verify templates are working correctly in `templates/` directory
3. Test script functionality in the `scripts/` directory
4. Ensure memory files (`memory/constitution.md`) are updated if major process changes are made
