# LaunchPad - Official Strapi Demo

![LaunchPad](./LaunchPad.jpg)

Welcome aboard **LaunchPad**, the official Strapi demo application, where we launch your content into the stratosphere at the speed of  *"we-can't-even-measure-it!"*.
This repository contains the following:

- A Strapi project with content-types and data already onboard
- A Next.js client that's primed and ready to fetch the content from Strapi faster than you can say "blast off!"

## 🌌 Get started

Strap yourself in! You can get started with this project on your local machine by following the instructions below, or you can [request a private instance on our website](https://strapi.io/demo)

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you take off, make sure you have the right env variables loaded for each part (rocket science at its best):

Strapi (example in `./strapi/.env.example`):
  - `STRAPI_ADMIN_CLIENT_URL=<url-of-nextjs>`
  - `STRAPI_ADMIN_CLIENT_PREVIEW_SECRET=<a-random-token>`

- Create a `./strapi/.env` file with these variables

Next.js (example in `./next/.env.sample`):
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<url-of-strapi>` (mandatory)
  - `PREVIEW_SECRET=<the-same-random-token-as-for-strapi>`

- Create a `./next/.env` file with these variables

## 1. Clone Launchpad

To infinity and beyond! 🚀 Clone the repo with this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/strapi/launchpad.git
```

- Navigate to your project folder by running `cd launchpad`.

## 2. Start Strapi

Take a deep breath. It's time to power up the Strapi engines. Navigate to your ./my-projects/launchpad/strapi folder by running:

Navigate to your `./my-projects/launchpad/strapi` folder by running `cd strapi` from your command line.

- Run the following command in your `./launchpad/strapi` folder:

```
yarn && yarn seed && yarn develop
```

This will install dependencies, sprinkle in some data magic, and run the server. (You can run these commands separately, but why not be efficient?)

## 3. Start Next.js

We're almost ready for lift-off! Next.js is your sleek, futuristic interface for getting all that glorious content out into the world. 🚀

Navigate to your `./my-projects/launchpad/next` folder by running `cd next` from your command line.

- Run the following command in your `./launchpad/next` folder

```
yarn && yarn build && yarn start
```

This installs dependencies, builds your project, and starts your server. You’re now a spacefaring content master!

## Customization

- The Strapi application contains a custom population middleware in order to populate more data than what it is set by default. You can find it in the `./strapi/src/middlewares/deepPopulate.ts` file.

- The Strapi application contains a postinstall script that will regenerate an uuid for the project in order to get some anonymous usage information concerning this demo. You can disable it by removing the uuid inside the `./strapi/packages.json` file.

- The Strapi application contains a patch for the @strapi/admin package. It is only necessary for the hosted demos since we automatically create the Super Admin users for them when they request this demo on our website.
