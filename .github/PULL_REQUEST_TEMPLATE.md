Describe the issue you are solving.

Simply make sure the whole Strapi application doesn't crash and the connected Next.js application is fully working.

Some additional things to check:

- [ ] Strapi project uuid is "LAUNCHPAD". `strapi/packages.json`.
- [ ] Strapi version is the latest possible.
- [ ] If the Strapi version has been changed, make sure that the `strapi/scripts/prefillLoginFields.js` works.
- [ ] If you updated content, make sure to create a new export in the `strapi/data` folder and update the `strapi/packages.json` seed command if necessary.
