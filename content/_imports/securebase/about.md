From Humble Beginnings

Peter’s fascination with human nature and behavior was ignited when his father immigrated to the United States to study computer science.

Peter is a lifelong learner, constantly pursuing knowledge both formally and informally. He enjoys reading, staying active, mastering new hobbies, and soaking in the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest, where he lives with his family and their loyal doodle, Hobbes.
