"Peter is incredibly perceptive, insightful, culturally-savvy, and funny! He brilliantly touched on core issues and we can all feel the excitement building inside of us as we felt the things he said. We felt hope and confidence rising as the things he was articulating resonated deeply. I am still in awe of how powerful a talk can be."

COO

"It’s like he’s in the room with us, feeling us, knowing what we’re thinking. Things started waking up in me and I started caring about what he was talking about. It wasn’t just about work stuff but home, marriage , kids, and my life. It’s like the fog lifted and I could see how things worked. I loved it."

John K.

Senior Manager

"Peter was the perfect neutral, third party entity to help us get to the bottom of the issue. He worked with our CEO, department leads, and myself to help us hear each other, get on the same side of the table, and make a plan to move forward. He is very gifted at getting to the bottom of the issue quickly without creating undue stress on the system. Then he spoke to our entire organization, multiple times, to get everyone on board with new vision, purpose, and hope. It was  something truly brilliant to behold."

COO
