## Grow in awareness

What's really going on, with you personally or at work? Coaching will help leaders increase their awareness and emotional intelligence, and identify intention-impact gaps. Gain clarity, build confidence, and create a roadmap for your personal and professional success.

## Increase your agency

The key is to get started, by doing the first thing, however small. Awareness, accountability, and meaningful action makes the difference! You need a caring outsider because hope shows up when people who care show up. You don't have to be alone. Connect with a caring coach today!

Do you feel stuck and unable to effectively work towards your desires and goals? Let's figure out together what's really going on and help you solve for "X". It's possible!

### Sacred process

](#)

We don't take anything for granted but sincerely listen and look. We hold you and the space you need to ask, explore, learn, grow, and create strategies that are rooted in truth and grace.  

[

### Clear and active

](#)

Taking action and moving forward can happen meaningfully when you're clear about your problems and the growth opportunities before you. See clearly and you will act meaningfully.

### Six one-on-one sessions

A good starting place for most leaders is a two-week coaching intensive, beginning with personalized psychometric assessments to help establish a personal and leadership baseline. In six sessions, you will come to a profound new self-understanding, a deep, broad, and nuanced perspective of your organization, situation, and season, and an increasing desire to grow and do good work.

## Intake Conversation

In the initial intake conversation, we will align on the 3 A’s: Agreement, Alliance, and Agenda. We will agree on the terms of engagement, begin to establish mutual trust, and co-create the agenda for our time together.

### One

Review your assessments, set the pace, and take our first steps toward your goals.

### Two

We dive deeper into your context, gathering information, and getting to know other key players. Challenges are identified.

### Three

We evaluate your first actions and experiments, refine insights, and develop deeper strategies.

### Four

We consider accountability and support systems to ensure health and sustainability in your process.

### Five

We review your progress and design a new, effective way of working that aligns with your goals.

### Six

We crystallize and codify the lessons learned, ensuring your attitudes and behaviors in your new way of living and leading.

## Become a good leader

Coaching places the client at the center of the emotional space through disciplined attunement that helps to organize the client's thoughts and feelings, creating meaning out of previously scattered and fuzzy pieces of the puzzle. Breakthroughs, getting unstuck, and knowing just what to do next – these outcomes result from newfound clarity, self-definition, and a strengthened sense of agency. Coaching is different from counseling, which tends to gaze at the past, and from consulting, which tends to lead with answers.

"I felt stuck in my leadership, unsure of myself, and what proper next steps would be helpful. With Peter, I experienced a masterful blend of non-judgmental inquiry and clear challenges that helped me get unstuck."

Mark P.

Board Chair

"I was so turned around that couldn’t see straight. Peter deftly helped guide me to clarity through incisive questioning and encouragement. With intelligence and insight, he supported my discovery process and helped me define my expectations, hopes, and intentions. At every stage of our work together, I've felt his gentle yet firm insistence in my personal worth and professional competence. Sometimes you need to look through someone else's eyes to see yourself clearly, and I'm so thankful that Peter has been that person for me."

Suzannah C.

Professor

"Peter clearly cares for those he is working with and I leave my times with Peter feeling both encouraged and challenged, with big goals and small steps. Peter is really good at honest, occasionally sobering reality checks wrapped in kindness. I always know he is in my corner and I know he won't hold back hard truths."
